This directory contains tests which are intended to be run manually, rather than as part of an automated testing suite.

Tests of this nature include tests which interface with third-party apps, where the ability to test their logic is limited, 
the tests are resource-intensive, and the proper functionality of the logic is dependent on the third-party app.
